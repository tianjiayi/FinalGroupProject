Simulating Airline Reservation System (JAVA)

• Developed a system for both customers and administrators to search/retrieve flights based on different criteria,
book flight-tickets, and update flight information from database
• Developed back-end platform using Java and connected the system with database by using MySQL as RDBMS
• Maintained and debugged the application
• Established the Data Model with UML for the class diagram of the project structure

The project simulates an airline reservation system using java eclipse. 
The two types of user for this system are customers and administrators. 
Customers can search for flight information and book flight-ticket through this system. 
Administrators can do the same things as customers but have more privileges, such as adding or deleting flights. 
New customers need to register first before logging in to their account. 
Upon logging in, if customers forget their password, they could find their password back by answering security questions. 
After their logged in their account, their previous booked flight information should be there in his/her account. 
On the main menu, users could do certain activities by entering corresponse numbers. 
The activities include searching flights by departure and arrival cities, booking flight tickets, checking booked information, and all flight information. 
In any case they could go back to the main menu and make a new selection.
